### hi there 👋

my name is nash, and i’m a beggining developer. my job is to provide developers with expert advice on extremely stupid topics. i read a lot and tell you how to be an idiot so you don't have to. i show you how to become an idiot, become one with the inner spirit of an idiot, and overall, be one of the most least intelligent humans on the face of the planet.
