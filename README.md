# hi, i'm nash, and i build stuff for the world wide web.

i am a self taught developer. i am a minor and from the united states. i started to learn over the year of 2020 while in lock down and started doing small projects in 2021 as well as learning **javascript** within 2021.

i currently know two programming languages which are luau and **javascript (node.js)**. i enjoy creating small projects and plan to create a full game soon. my main aim is to allow normal people to have free accesses to resources which they may need.

***if anyone has any questions or issues feel free to direct them towards me here by sending me a message. i am always happy to assist with any problems someone may have.***

signed, **nash**
